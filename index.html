    <h2>What is this about?</h2>
    <p>
      This platform is more than a diary‚Äîit's a movement. <strong>College Black Diaries</strong> is here to build a strong, supportive community for women students across India. By sharing your experiences‚Äîraw, painful, or eye-opening‚Äîyou are not just unburdening your heart, you are sparking awareness and paving the way for change. Even a single story can empower many, warn others, or help someone realize they are not alone. Despite decades since the Vishakha Guidelines, proper implementation in educational institutions remains rare. Harassment is normalized, complaints are silenced, and justice often feels out of reach. But silence helps no one. This is a call to all female students‚Äîshare your voice, your truth. <strong>Drop by drop, we fill the ocean.</strong> Your small act of courage today could lead to a revolution tomorrow.

    <h2>How to Report an Incident Effectively</h2>
    <p>
      If you‚Äôre ready to take a step beyond sharing anonymously and want to report an incident formally, here‚Äôs a quick guide that may help:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Document Everything:</strong> Record dates, times, details, screenshots‚Äîanything that may support your case.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Know Your Rights:</strong> Understand the <a href="https://www.shebox.nic.in/" target="_blank">Vishakha Guidelines</a> and the <a href="https://wcd.nic.in/sites/default/files/Sexual-Harassment-at-Workplace-Act.pdf" target="_blank">POSH Act</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Reach the Right Authority:</strong> Report to your college‚Äôs ICC (Internal Complaints Committee) or Women‚Äôs Cell.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Seek Support:</strong> Don‚Äôt go through it alone‚Äîtalk to supportive peers, teachers, or NGOs.</li>
      <li><strong>5. Use Online Portals:</strong> File complaints at <a href="https://www.shebox.nic.in/" target="_blank">SHe-Box</a> or <a href="https://cybercrime.gov.in/" target="_blank">Cybercrime Portal</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>6. Follow Up:</strong> Keep a copy of your complaint and escalate if necessary to UGC or the Women‚Äôs Commission.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You are not alone. Your voice matters. ü§ç</p>
